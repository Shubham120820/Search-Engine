# Search-Engine
A search engine is a webapp program that helps people to find the information they are looking for online using keywords or phrases.

Technologies used in project :- HTML, CSS, JSP, Java Servlets, and MySQL.

The project will consist of three components: front end, back end, and a database.

HTML will be used for the front end, which is responsible for creating the structure of the web page. 
CSS will be used for styling the web page, including elements such as background color, font color, and alignment. 
JSP (Java Server Pages) will be used to connect the front end to the back end by allowing Java code to be written inside HTML files. 
Java Servlets will be used for the back end, specifically for creating multiple mini servers to handle different types of calculations or operations. 
MySQL, a popular database management system, will be used for storing and interacting with data.

The web application consists of three major components: front end, back end, and database. 
Front end: Responsible for the client-side of the application, where the user interacts with the application. 
Back end: Handles the server-side of the application, processing requests from the client and generating responses. 
Database: Stores and manages the data used by the web application.
